# Data Integration Pipeline

## Description
This project is a data integration pipeline (DIP) composed of one or more data integration elements (DIEs). The DIEs consist primarily of a single Python script that calls on utility functions to extract, transform, and load data. A config.ini file should be set by the user to define data source and destination details, including credentials, ports, connection string, and so on.
